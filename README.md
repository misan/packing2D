Through the magic of Google's Gemini Pro 2.5 I have got this library https://github.com/mses-bly/2D-Bin-Packing migrated into C++ so it can be used from Python too. 

Both the code and the .md file have been developed by an IA and not by myself, though I would say I help in the process ;-)

I have tested in an M1 Mac and in Ubuntu Linux. 

Some of the features as the parallel execution ended up working slower than sequential one, though in some cases manage to create a better packing. Just know it is not any faster.
